# Face Detector Using Deep Learning .

## Overview
Deep learning is now more accessible than ever before for organizations of any size. Face recognition is a biometric system used to identify or verify a person from a digital image. Face recognition is one of the most used methods in the field of image analysis. 

The **goal** of this project is to build a deep neural network model that uses image data to extract its features and then recognize it, regardless of lighting, expression, illumination, ageing, transformations (translate, rotate and scale image) and pose, which is a difficult task , This project can be used for Security cameras, Offices, University, ATM, Bank, in any locations with a security and to collect criminal's images automatically and notify the authorities.

## Data
We used a dataset of Facial Detector Dataset collected from Pinterest using Kaggle website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hereisburak/pins-face-recognition?select=105_classes_pins_dataset) .

This image has been collected from Pinterest and cropped. There are 105 celebrities and 17534 faces.

## Algorithms
Deep learing algorithms that has been used in this project:
- NN
- CNN
- Transfer Learning
  -  DenseNet
  -  VGG-16
  -  VGG-19
  -  InceptionV3
  -  ResNet50

## Tools
- Pandas library will be used to create data frames.
- Sklearn library will be to implement the baseline classification models.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn and visualkeras to visualize and discuss the results of the analysis.
- keras and tensorflow for deep learing models and image preprocessing.
